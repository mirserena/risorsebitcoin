# risorsebitcoin by Mir


My list of Bitcoin RESOURCES IN ITALIAN.
So, in essence, the idea is that you may not even know English (besides Bitcoin, wallet, hello, the cat is on the table ...) to use and learn Bitcoin thanks to these resources. And you can also stay in the beautiful country for some services.

A list for today, for today. Constantly changing.

Certainly something is missing, which I have missed or has not yet been created.
Surely something is there by mistake or it doesn't work anymore.

So ENJOY! (heck another word in English)

If you want to CONTRIBUTE by adding resources, correcting or proposing new / different categories ... I'll explain better in point 10.
If you want to make a small donation with Lightning Network you can use the tippin.me service: http://tippin.me/@mir_btc

Let's go!

- ## ** 10 - How to contribute to the list **

  Anyone can propose CHANGES through PULL REQUEST: don't be shy.
  But I warn you that I will cut a lot of them because (one or more of the following):

  - you are a shitcoiner (nothing personal, even the best have been there)
  - you are my friends who want to waste my time
  - you are people who want to show me what true decentralization is (I hear you: "this repo is too centralized". But nothing remains the queen of my resources).
  - you are bots, appreciable but boring
  - you are my ghost-writer and you no longer agree with the selection
